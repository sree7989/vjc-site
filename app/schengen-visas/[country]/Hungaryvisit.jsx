          A Hungary Visit/Tourist Visa is a short-term Schengen visa that allows travellers to visit Hungary for tourism, leisure, business meetings, family visits, or other short-term purposes. As a member of the Schengen Area, Hungary permits visa holders to travel to other Schengen countries with the same visa, making it an excellent starting point for those wishing to explore Europe.
