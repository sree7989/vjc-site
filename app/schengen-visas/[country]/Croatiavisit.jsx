          A Croatia Visit/Tourist Visa is a short-stay visa that allows foreign nationals to visit Croatia for tourism purposes. It’s typically valid for stays up to 90 days within a 180-day period. The visa is suitable for those who wish to explore Croatia's picturesque scenery, indulge in the rich culture, and experience the warm Mediterranean climate.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-black">Visa Validity</h2>
      <p>
        The Croatia Visit/Tourist Visa generally allows stays of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. This visa can be issued for a single or multiple entries, depending on the specific needs of the traveler and the approval from the Croatian embassy or consulate. For those planning to explore multiple cities or regions, this visa provides flexibility and convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Single-Entry Visa allows one entrance to Croatia for up to 90 days, while Multiple-Entry Visa is ideal for frequent travelers, allowing several visits within the validity period while still respecting the 90/180 rule—so you can explore coastal gems like Split, Zadar, and Hvar, along with inland treasures such as Zagreb and national parks.
