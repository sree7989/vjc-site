      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What is a Greece Visit/Tourist Visa?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A Greece Tourist Visa is a short-stay Schengen visa that allows non-EU/EEA nationals to visit Greece for tourism, family visits, or business purposes for a stay of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Greece is a member of the Schengen Area, meaning the visa grants you access to not only Greece but also 25 other European countries.
