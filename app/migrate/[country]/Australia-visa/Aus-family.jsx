      <h4 className="mb-6 font-semibold">Types of Australia Family Visas</h4>

      <h5 className="font-semibold">1. Partner Visa (Subclass 820 & 801)</h5>
      <p className="mb-6">For married or de facto couples, the Partner Visa allows one partner to live in Australia while waiting for the permanent visa. It includes two stages:</p>
      <ul className="ml-8 list-disc mb-6">
        <li><strong>Temporary Visa (Subclass 820):</strong> Granted initially, allowing you to stay in Australia while your application is processed.</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent Visa (Subclass 801):</strong> This visa is granted once you’ve proven the genuineness of your relationship over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">Whether you are in a married or de facto relationship, the Partner Visa provides a pathway to permanent residency for your spouse or partner.</p>

      <h5 className="font-semibold">2. Parent Visa (Subclass 103 & 804)</h5>
      <p className="mb-6">If you have children living in Australia and wish to be close to them, the Parent Visa is the ideal option. There are several types, but the most common ones are:</p>
      <ul className="ml-8 list-disc mb-6">
        <li><strong>Parent Visa (Subclass 103):</strong> A permanent visa for parents of Australian citizens, permanent residents, or eligible New Zealand citizens. This visa allows you to join your family in Australia on a permanent basis.</li>
        <li><strong>Contributory Parent Visa (Subclass 143):</strong> A quicker option, but with a higher application fee. It allows for faster processing and grants permanent residency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">Whether you are in a married or de facto relationship, the Parent Visa provides a pathway to permanent residency for your parent(s).</p>

      <h5 className="font-semibold">3. Child Visa (Subclass 101 & 802)</h5>
      <p className="mb-6">Parents who are Australian citizens or permanent residents can sponsor their children to join them in Australia.</p>
      <ul className="ml-8 list-disc mb-6">
        <li><strong>Child Visa (Subclass 101):</strong> For children outside Australia, allowing them to join their parents.</li>
        <li><strong>Adoption Visa (Subclass 102):</strong> For children adopted by Australian citizens or permanent residents.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">This visa is also available for stepchildren, biological children, and those in the legal custody of the applicant.</p>

      <h5 className="font-semibold">4. Other Family Member Visas</h5>
      <p className="mb-6">Besides the immediate family members, Australia also offers options for extended family members to migrate. These include:</p>
      <ul className="ml-8 list-disc mb-6">
        <li><strong>Aged Dependent Relative Visa (Subclass 114):</strong> For elderly relatives who rely on their Australian family member for support.</li>
        <li><strong>Remaining Relative Visa (Subclass 115):</strong> For relatives who have no other close family members outside Australia.</li>
        <li><strong>Carer Visa (Subclass 116):</strong> For those who are required to provide personal care to an Australian relative with a medical condition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 className="font-semibold">5. Visitor Visas for Family Visits</h5>
      <p className="mb-6">If your primary intention is to visit your family in Australia temporarily, the <strong>Visitor Visa (Subclass 600)</strong> may be an option. While this visa doesn’t offer permanent residency, it allows you to stay in Australia for up to 12 months while spending time with your loved ones.</p>
