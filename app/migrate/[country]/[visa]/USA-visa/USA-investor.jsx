        The USA offers several visa options for individuals wishing to invest in its economy, create jobs, and live in the United States. One of the most popular options for foreign investors is the <b>EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program</b>. This program allows eligible foreign nationals to obtain a <Link href="https://www.vjcoverseas.com/pr-visas/usa-green-card" className="text-orange-600">U.S. Permanent Residency</Link> by making a qualifying investment in a U.S. business that creates or preserves jobs for U.S. workers.

      <h4 className="mb-6 m-2 text-sky-700">Key Features of the USA Investor Visa (EB-5)</h4>
      <ul className='ml-8 mb-6 list-decimal'>
        <li><b>Eligibility: </b> The EB-5 Investor Visa is available to foreign nationals and their immediate family (spouse and children under 21) who make a substantial investment in a U.S. business.</li>
        <li><b>Investment Requirement: </b>The required investment amount typically ranges from $900,000 to $1.8 million, depending on the project and location. The investment must create or preserve at least 10 full-time jobs for U.S. workers.</li>
        <li><b>Permanent Residency:  </b>Successful applicants receive a two-year conditional Green Card, which can be converted to permanent residency after meeting job creation requirements.</li>
        <li><b>Processing Time:  </b>The processing time for the EB-5 visa varies, but it generally takes about 18-24 months to obtain a Green Card, depending on individual circumstances, regional centres, and USCIS processing times.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="mb-6 m-2 text-sky-700">USA Investor Visa Eligibility Requirements</h4>
      <p>To qualify for the USA Investor Visa (EB-5), applicants must meet specific criteria and unlike the <Link href="https://www.vjcoverseas.com/visit-visas/usa" className="text-orange-600">USA Visit Visa</Link>, this visa is focused on long-term investments and immigration.</p>
      <ul className='ml-8 mb-6 list-decimal'>
        <li><b>Investment Amount:</b></li>
        <ul style={{listStyleType:"circle"}} className='m-2 mb-6 ml-8'>
          <li><b>$1.8 million</b> if investing in a business outside a Targeted Employment Area (TEA).</li>
          <li><b>$900,000</b> if investing in a business within a Targeted Employment Area (rural or high-unemployment areas).</li>

        <li><b>Active Involvement:</b> While the investor does not have to be involved in the day-to-day operations of the business, they must show that they have a direct role in the management or policy formulation of the enterprise.</li>
