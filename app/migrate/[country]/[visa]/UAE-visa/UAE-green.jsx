        Living Expenses in the UAE
      </h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The UAE is known for its high standard of living, but the cost of living
        can vary depending on the emirate you choose to reside in and your
        lifestyle. Here's a general breakdown of living expenses in the UAE:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc mb-6 ml-8">
        <li>
          <b>Accommodation:</b> Rent is one of the biggest expenses in the UAE.
          In cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, monthly rents can range from AED
          3,000 for a small apartment to AED 10,000 or more for a larger,
          premium property in central areas. Sharjah and Ajman offer more
          budget-friendly options.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Utilities:</b> Utility bills (electricity, water, internet, etc.)
          typically cost between AED 400 to AED 1,200 per month, depending on the
          size of your accommodation and usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Groceries and Food:</b> You can expect to spend around AED 1,000 to
          AED 2,500 per month on groceries, with dining out ranging from AED 25
          for a casual meal to AED 150 for a fine dining experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Transportation:</b> Public transportation in the UAE is affordable,
          with metro and bus fares starting from AED 3 per ride. If you prefer
          to drive, fuel prices are relatively low compared to other countries,
          and car rental prices typically range from AED 1,500 to AED 3,000 per
          month for mid-range vehicles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Healthcare:</b> The UAE boasts world-class healthcare facilities,
          but it’s recommended to have health insurance, which can cost anywhere
          between AED 500 to AED 2,000 per month depending on the coverage and
          provider.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Overall, the cost of living in the UAE is manageable, especially when
        you compare it to other global cities like London, New York, or Paris,
        offering a luxurious lifestyle with tax-free income.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-black m-2 font-bold text-lg mb-6">Lifestyle and Opportunities in the UAE</h3>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Holding a Green Visa means you’ll enjoy a lifestyle that blends business
