            What is a UAE Work Visa?
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-6">
            A UAE Work Visa, also known as a residence visa, allows foreign
            nationals to work and live in the UAE for a fixed period, usually
            tied to your employment contract. To obtain one, you must secure a
            job offer from a UAE-registered employer who will sponsor your visa
            application. The process is highly structured, ensuring that all
            expatriates meet legal, medical, and professional requirements
            before starting their employment.
