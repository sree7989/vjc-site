          <h4 className="mb-6 m-2 font-bold text-black">What is an H1B Visa?</h4>

          <p className="mb-6">The H1B Visa is a non-immigrant visa that enables U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in roles that require specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or higher (or equivalent). These roles are typically in fields like IT, engineering, healthcare, finance, and other technical sectors.</p>

      <h4 className="mb-6 m-2 font-bold text-lg text-black">H1B Visa Eligibility</h4>
      <p className="mb-6 m-2">To qualify for an H1B Visa, you must meet the following criteria:</p>

      <ul className='ml-8 mb-6 list-decimal'>
        <li><b>Specialty Occupation: </b> You must be applying for a job in a specialized field that requires a minimum of a bachelor’s degree or equivalent.</li>
        <li><b>Employer Sponsorship: </b>You must have a job offer from a U.S. employer who is willing to sponsor your visa.</li>
        <li><b>Educational Qualifications: </b>You should hold at least a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent in the specific field required for the job.</li>
        <li><b>Labour Condition Application(LCA): </b> Your employer must file an LCA with the Department of Labour to confirm that hiring a foreign worker will not adversely affect the working conditions or wages of U.S. workers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="mb-6 m-2 font-bold text-lg text-black">Key Features of the H1B Visa</h4>

      <ul className='list-disc mb-6 ml-8'>
        <li><b>Duration: </b>The H1B Visa is typically granted for an initial period of 3 years, with the possibility of extending up to 6 years.</li>
        <li><b>Dependents: </b>You can bring your spouse and children under 21 on an H4 Visa. However, your spouse may not be authorized to work unless they apply for and receive specific work authorization.</li>
        <li><b>Dual Intent:  </b>The H1B Visa allows for dual intent, meaning you can apply for a green card (permanent residency) while on an H1B Visa.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="mb-6 m-2 font-bold text-lg text-black">H1B Visa Process & Timeline</h4>
      <p className="mb-6 m-2">The application process for the H1B Visa involves several steps and careful preparation. Below is an overview of the H1B Visa application process and the typical timeline:</p>

      <h4 className="mb-6 italic m-2 text-sky-700">1. Employer Petition Filing (April - June)</h4>
      <p className='mb-6 m-2'>The U.S. employer must submit a Labour Condition Application (LCA) to the U.S. Department of Labour. This process typically begins in <b>April</b>, with applications being filed for the next fiscal year.</p>
      <h4 className="mb-6 italic m-2 text-sky-700">2. H1B Registration & Lottery (March - April)</h4>
      <p className='mb-6 m-2'>The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) conducts a lottery to select which petitions will be processed, as there is an annual cap of 65,000 visas, with an additional 20,000 visas available for applicants with a U.S. master's degree or higher.</p>

      <h4 className="mb-6 italic m-2 text-sky-700">3. Petition Filing with USCIS (April - May)</h4>
