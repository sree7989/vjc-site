      <h4 className="mb-6"><b>What is the Australia Dependent Visa?</b></h4>

      <p className="mb-6">The <b>Australia Dependent Visa</b> allows the immediate family members of primary visa holders to live, work, and study in Australia for the duration of the primary visa holder’s stay. Family members who may be eligible for this visa include spouses, children, parents, and in some cases, other relatives depending on the specific visa subclass.</p>

      <h4 className="mb-6"><b>Key Features of the Dependent Visa</b></h4>

      <ul className='ml-6 mb-6'>
        <li><b>• Stay with Primary Visa Holder: </b>Dependent visa holders are allowed to live, study, and work in Australia for the same duration as the primary visa holder.</li>
        <li><b>• Work Rights: </b>In most cases, dependents can work full-time in Australia, offering them financial independence and the ability to contribute to their household’s living expenses.</li>
        <li><b>• Access to Healthcare: </b>Dependent visa holders are generally eligible for Australia’s public health system (Medicare), depending on the visa subclass and the primary visa holder’s status.</li>
        <li><b>• Study Opportunities: </b>Family members, particularly children, can also access Australia’s quality education system, from primary school to university-level courses.</li>
      </ul>

        <li><b>2. Student Visa Dependent (Subclass 500): </b>If you are the partner or child of an international student studying in Australia, you can apply for a dependent visa to accompany them during their studies.</li>
        <li><b>3. Temporary Skill Shortage Visa (Subclass 482): </b>Dependents of individuals holding a temporary skill shortage visa can apply for a dependent visa to stay with their family while the primary visa holder works in Australia.</li>
        <li><b>4. Permanent Residency Dependent (Subclass 189/190): </b>If the primary visa holder is a permanent resident or holds a skilled migration visa, their family members can apply for a dependent visa to join them in Australia.</li>
