      <p className="mb-6">The <b>Australia Business</b> Visa allows entrepreneurs, investors, and business owners to enter and stay in Australia to manage, establish, or invest in a business. It provides a range of pathways for individuals who want to capitalize on Australia’s thriving economy, whether by starting a new business, buying into an existing one, or investing in a state or territory’s growth.</p>

      <p className="mb-6">Australia offers several types of business visas, each catering to different needs and goals. These visas are designed to encourage innovation, investment, and business development across the country.</p>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h4 className="mb-6"><b>Key Types of Australia Business Visas</b></h4>

        <p>1. <b>Business Innovation and Investment (Provisional) Visa (subclass 188)</b> The Subclass 188 visa is ideal for individuals looking to manage or invest in a business in Australia. It is a temporary visa with pathways to permanent residency. The visa has several streams:</p>

          <li><b>Significant Investor Stream:</b> For high-net-worth individuals ready to invest AUD 5 million into complying investments in Australia.</li>
          <li><b>Entrepreneur Stream:</b> For those who have a viable business idea and are supported by a state or territory government to start a business in Australia.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6"><b>2.

To be eligible, applicants need to be nominated by a state or territory government and meet certain financial thresholds.</p>

        <p className="mb-6"><b>3. Temporary Skill Shortage Visa (subclass 482)</b> This visa is ideal for individuals who need to fill skill shortages in Australian businesses.
