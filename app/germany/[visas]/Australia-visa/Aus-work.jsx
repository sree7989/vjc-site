It’s ideal for skilled workers in industries such as healthcare, IT, engineering, hospitality, and trades.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            The <b>Skilled Independent Visa (Subclass 189)</b> is for workers who are not sponsored by an employer, family member, or state/territory government but have skills that are in demand in Australia. It is a points-based visa, and applicants need to meet the required score to be invited to apply.
