    <h3 style={{ color: "black", fontWeight: "bold", marginBottom: '20px' }}>What is the UK Sponsorship Visa?</h3>
    <p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
      The UK Sponsorship Visa is a category of visa that requires an employer or educational institution in the UK to act as your sponsor. Depending on your specific situation, there are several types of Sponsorship Visas, including work visas and student visas, designed to attract skilled individuals from around the world.
    </p>
  
          <p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
            Work Visas are primarily for individuals who have secured a job offer from a licensed UK employer, while Student Visas are designed for those who have been accepted into a course of study at a recognized UK educational institution. In both cases, the sponsor must hold a valid sponsorship license and be authorized to issue a certificate of sponsorship to the applicant.
