    <p style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
      A UK Tourist Visa is a short-term visa that allows non-UK residents to visit the UK for up to 6 months. This visa is ideal for those looking to travel for tourism, to visit family or friends, or to engage in short-term business activities. The visa permits multiple entries within the validity period, giving you flexibility to plan your visit.
