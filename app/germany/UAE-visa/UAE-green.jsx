                Unlock Your Future in the UAE with a Green Visa
            </h3>

            <p className='mb-6'>The UAE has become one of the most attractive destinations for professionals, skilled workers, and investors seeking to live and work in a dynamic, modern economy. With the introduction of the Green Visa, the UAE aims to offer a more flexible and sustainable alternative to the traditional employment visa, focusing on skilled talent, freelancers, and investors. At VJC Overseas, we guide you through the entire process of obtaining a Green Visa and provide the necessary insights to ensure your successful transition to life in the UAE.</p>
    
            <p>Launched in 2021, the UAE Green Visa is a long-term residency permit designed to attract highly skilled professionals, investors, entrepreneurs, freelancers, and specialized talents to the UAE. Unlike the traditional work visa, the Green Visa does not require sponsorship from an employer, which means greater freedom and flexibility for holders. It is ideal for those who wish to establish long-term residence in the UAE, without being tied to a specific employer.</p>

                <li><b>Healthcare:</b> The UAE boasts world-class healthcare facilities, but it’s recommended to have health insurance, which can cost anywhere between AED 500 to AED 2,000 per month depending on the coverage and provider.</li>
