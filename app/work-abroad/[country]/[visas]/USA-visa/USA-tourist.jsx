      </ul>

      <h4 className="mb-6 m-2 font-bold text-lg text-black">Key Features of the H1B Visa</h4>

      <ul className='list-disc mb-6 ml-8'>
        <li><b>Duration: </b>The H1B Visa is typically granted for an initial period of 3 years, with the possibility of extending up to 6 years.</li>
        <li><b>Dependents: </b>You can bring your spouse and children under 21 on an H4 Visa. However, your spouse may not be authorized to work unless they apply for and receive specific work authorization.</li>
        <li><b>Dual Intent:  </b>The H1B Visa allows for dual intent, meaning you can apply for a green card (permanent residency) while on an H1B Visa.</li>

      <h4 className="mb-6 italic m-2 text-sky-700">2. H1B Registration & Lottery (March - April)</h4>
      <p className='mb-6 m-2'>The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) conducts a lottery to select which petitions will be processed, as there is an annual cap of 65,000 visas, with an additional 20,000 visas available for applicants with a U.S. master's degree or higher.</p>
