      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Types of Australia Work Visas</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base">
        Australia offers a range of work visas catering to different skills, qualifications, and employment needs. Below are the main categories of work visas:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-1xl font-bold mb-2">1. Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) Visa (Subclass 482)</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">
        The TSS Visa is one of the most common options for skilled workers seeking employment in Australia. This visa allows employers to sponsor workers for a period of 1 to 4 years, depending on the occupation. It’s ideal for skilled workers in industries such as healthcare, IT, engineering, hospitality, and trades.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Key Requirements:</strong><br />
        • A job offer from an Australian employer who is a recognized sponsor.<br />
        • Occupation listed on Australia’s Skilled Occupation List (SOL) or Short-Term Skilled Occupation List (STSOL).<br />
        • Meet skills and English language proficiency requirements.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-1xl font-bold mb-2">2. Skilled Independent Visa (Subclass 189)</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">
        The Skilled Independent Visa (Subclass 189) is for workers who are not sponsored by an employer, family member, or state/territory government but have skills that are in demand in Australia. It is a points-based visa, and applicants need to meet the required score to be invited to apply.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Key Requirements:</strong><br />
        • Occupation listed on the Skilled Occupation List (SOL).<br />
        • Pass a points test based on factors like age, education, work experience, and English language skills.<br />
        • Complete a skills assessment for your nominated occupation.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-1xl font-bold mb-2">3. Skilled Nominated Visa (Subclass 190)</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">
        The Skilled Nominated Visa is another points-based visa, but it requires nomination by a state or territory government in Australia. It allows you to live and work permanently in Australia in an occupation on the Skilled Occupation List (SOL).
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Key Requirements:</strong><br />
        • Nomination from an Australian state or territory government.<br />
        • Occupation listed on the Skilled Occupation List (SOL).<br />
        • Meet points test and pass skills assessments.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-1xl font-bold mb-2">4. Employer Nomination Scheme (ENS) Visa (Subclass 186)</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">
        The ENS Visa allows skilled workers who are nominated by their employer to live and work in Australia permanently. It is ideal for individuals who already have an employer in Australia willing to sponsor them.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Key Requirements:</strong><br />
        • A permanent job offer from an Australian employer.<br />
        • Occupation listed on the Skilled Occupation List (SOL).<br />
        • Meet skills and experience requirements, including a skills assessment.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-1xl font-bold mb-2">5. Working Holiday Visa (Subclass 417 & 462)</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">
        For younger travelers who want to work and explore Australia, the Working Holiday Visa is a great option. This visa allows people between 18 and 30 years old (or 35 in some cases) to work in Australia for up to 12 months, with the possibility of extending the stay if certain work requirements are met.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Key Requirements:</strong><br />
        • Aged between 18 and 30 (or 35 for certain countries).<br />
        • Be a passport holder of an eligible country.<br />
        • Sufficient funds to support yourself at the start of your stay.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Australia PR Visa</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">

Permanent residency in Australia offers long-term stability, access to public benefits, and the opportunity to eventually apply for citizenship.
