            What is the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program (AIPP) is an employer-driven
            immigration pathway designed to attract skilled workers and
            international graduates to Canada’s Atlantic provinces. Employers in
            this region can hire foreign nationals to fill labor shortages
            without requiring a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), making
            it a faster and more streamlined immigration option.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">The AIPP offers three distinct streams:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-1">
            <li>
              <strong>Atlantic High-Skilled Program (AHSP):</strong> For skilled
              workers with a job offer from a designated employer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Atlantic Intermediate-Skilled Program (AISP):</strong> For
              semi-skilled or entry-level workers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Atlantic International Graduate Program (AIGP):</strong>{" "}
              For international graduates from recognized Atlantic institutions.
