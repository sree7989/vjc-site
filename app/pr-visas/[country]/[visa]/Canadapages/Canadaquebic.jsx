            <strong>What is the Quebec Skilled Worker Program?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Quebec Selected Skilled Workers Program (QSWP) is a provincial immigration initiative managed by Quebec
            itself. Unlike other Canadian provinces, Quebec operates independently from the federal Express Entry system,
            setting its own criteria and selection process for skilled professionals.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The program is designed to attract candidates who can contribute effectively to Quebec’s labor market and
            integrate into its society. Selection is based on a points-based grid that evaluates factors such as
            education, work experience, age, language proficiency (primarily French), adaptability, and personal
            characteristics.
