          <p>
            The Canada Intra-Company Transfer Program is part of the International Mobility Program
            and is designed to facilitate the smooth movement of skilled employees within
            multinational companies. It allows foreign businesses to transfer eligible employees to
            a Canadian branch, subsidiary, or affiliate, supporting business growth while
            contributing to the Canadian economy.
