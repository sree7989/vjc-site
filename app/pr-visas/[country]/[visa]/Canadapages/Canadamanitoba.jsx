          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-700">What is Express Entry?</h2>
          <p>
            Express Entry is an online application management system created by the Government of Canada to oversee applications for permanent residence under three economic immigration programs:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)</li>
            <li>Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)</li>
            <li>Canadian Experience Class (CEC)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each pathway is designed to attract skilled individuals who can contribute to Canada’s economy. Applications are evaluated using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), which assigns points based on education, age, work experience, language skills, and other factors.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-700">How the Process Works</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
            <li><strong>Profile Creation:</strong> Applicants create an online profile including personal details, test scores, education, and work experience. Eligible profiles are then placed in the Express Entry pool.</li>
            <li><strong>Invitation to Apply (ITA):</strong> Regular draws are conducted by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), and candidates with the highest CRS scores receive an ITA.</li>
            <li><strong>Submitting the PR Application:</strong> Once invited, applicants have 60 days to submit all documents and complete their <Link href="https://www.vjcoverseas.com/pr-visas/canada-pr" className="text-orange-600 font-bold">Canada PR Visa</Link> application.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-700">Boosting Your CRS Score</h2>
