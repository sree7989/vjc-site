              What is the Provincial Nominee Program?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The PNP allows provinces and territories in Canada to nominate candidates who wish to settle in their specific region. Each province operates its own program with unique eligibility criteria tailored to meet labor market and demographic needs. Participating regions include Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories, and Yukon. Quebec, however, manages its own independent selection system.

          {/* How PNP Works */}
          <section>
            <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-black mb-2">How the PNP Works</h2>
            <p>
              There are two main routes to apply for a provincial nomination:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mt-2 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Express Entry-Linked PNP:</strong> These streams are aligned with the federal Express Entry system. Receiving a provincial nomination adds 600 CRS points, almost guaranteeing an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residency.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Non-Express Entry (Paper-Based Application):</strong> Candidates can apply directly to a province under its unique criteria. After receiving a nomination, the application is then submitted to IRCC for permanent residency.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">
              For many international professionals, the <a href="https://www.vjcoverseas.com/pr-visas/canada-pr" className="text-orange-500 font-semibold">Canada PR Visa</a> becomes easier to secure through the Provincial Nominee Program, especially for those targeting specific in-demand occupations.
