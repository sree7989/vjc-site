            <p className="text-lxl leading-relaxed mb-6 mt-10">
                The Quebec Selected Workers Program (QSWP) is a popular immigration pathway for skilled workers who wish to settle and work in the province of Quebec. This program is designed to attract talented individuals who have the skills and experience to contribute to Quebec’s dynamic economy and diverse society. Unlike other Canadian immigration programs, the QSWP is unique because it is managed by the province of Quebec, which has its own immigration policies and selection criteria.
