      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-[#0D5BA8]">What is the Austria Tourist Visa?</h2>
      <p className="mb-5 text-base text-justify leading-snug">
        For Indian nationals, Austria is part of the Schengen Area, and hence, travelers need to apply for a Schengen Tourist Visa to visit Austria. This visa allows you to stay up to 90 days within a 180-day period for tourism, business, or family visits. The application process involves submitting documents to the Austrian consulate or visa center and sometimes attending a biometric appointment.
