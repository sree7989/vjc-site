      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-[#DC143C]">What is a France Tourist Visa?</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-justify leading-snug mb-6">
        France is part of the Schengen Area, which means Indian citizens need a Schengen Tourist Visa to visit the country. This visa allows you to travel not only within France but also across 26 other European countries for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Apart from France, you can also travel across Schengen countries like Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and more.
