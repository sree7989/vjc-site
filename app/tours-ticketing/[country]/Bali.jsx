      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 text-[#0D5BA8]">What is a Bali Tourist Visa?</h2>
      <p className="mb-5 text-base text-justify leading-snug">
        Bali is part of Indonesia, and to visit Bali for tourism, Indian citizens require an Indonesian Tourist Visa. Depending on the purpose and length of stay, you can apply for either a <strong>Visa on Arrival (VoA)</strong>, <strong>e-Visa</strong>, or a <strong>Social-Cultural Visa</strong> (for longer stays). The most common for tourists is the VoA, which allows a stay of up to 30 days with an option to extend.
